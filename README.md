# CSC 133 Game Devolpment

This is a place where I store my game that I developed in my CSC 133 class. 
Branches are set up by the assignments that were graded in the class. 

This project was made using object oriented programming principles. The programs are witten in Java and use the Codename1 IDE for application development. The code that you see here does not include things neeeded to completely run the program in codename1. 


This repository is for educational purposes only, I do not take any responsibility if you are caught reusing this code.
